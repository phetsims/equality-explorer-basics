# Equality Explorer: Basics - model description

The _Basics_ screen is identical to the _Basics_ screen in the _Equality Explorer_ simulation.

The _Lab_ screen is similar to the _Variables_ screen in the _Equality Explorer_ simulation, but
uses symbolic objects (circle, cube, triangle) instead of mathematical symbols (x, y) for variables.

For additional model details, see [equality-explorer/doc/model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/blob/main/doc/model.md).
